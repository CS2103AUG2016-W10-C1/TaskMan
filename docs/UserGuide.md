##About
TaskMan is a task management application that aims to simplify the way you work with your tasks and events. It is a Java desktop application that can work offline, without requiring Internet connection. 

It uses a simple graphical user interface to display your events and tasks. Instead of trying to find and click buttons all over the screen, you just need to type through your keyboard to give the necessary commands, and TaskMan will do the rest for you. 

## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
1. Download the latest `taskman.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TaskMan.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.
5. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`list`**: lists all tasks
   * **`add`**` CS2103T Tutorial d/wed 9.59am start/tue 11.59pm end/wed 4am` :
     adds a task titled `CS2103T Tutorial` to TaskMan
   * **`delete`**` 3`: deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
   * **`exit`**: exits the app
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>


## Features

> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.

> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
> * The order of parameters is not fixed.

#### Viewing help: `help`
Command Format: `help`

> Help is also shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. `abcd`
 
#### Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task to TaskMan<br>
Command Format: `add TITLE [d/DEADLINE] [p/PERIOD] [c/] [r/FREQUENCY] [t/TAG]...`

Parameter | Format
-------- | :-------- 
`PERIOD` | `DATETIME`, `DATETIME to DATETIME` or `DATETIME for X{h/d/w}’ where X is a number (non-negative integer or decimal) and h is hour, d is day, w is week. Event is taken to be 1 hour long if not specified. 
`DEADLINE` and `DATETIME` | `[next] ddd [hh[.mm]{am/pm}]` or `DD-MM-YYYY TT:TT`
`FREQUENCY` | `X{d/w/m/y}` where X is a natural number, d is day, m is month, and y is year.

The `PERIOD` represents the period of time the task is scheduled to be worked on. The presence of just `c/` will mark the task as completed.

> Tasks can have any number of tags. Tags may contain spaces and are case-insensitive (i.e. tags "school", "School", and "SCHOOL" are the same tags).

Examples:
* `add CS2103T Pre-Tutorial Work d/wed 9.59am p/tue 11.59pm to wed 4am`
* `add CS2101 HW d/next mon 11.59am t/CS2101 t/V0.0`

#### Adding an event: ‘add e ’
Adds a task to TaskMan<br>
Command Format: `add e TITLE [p/PERIOD] [r/FREQUENCY] [t/TAG]...`

Parameter | Format
-------- | :-------- 
`PERIOD` | `DATETIME`, `DATETIME to DATETIME` or `DATETIME for X{h/d/w}’ where X is a number (non-negative integer or decimal) and h is hour, d is day, w is week. Event is taken to be 1 hours long if not specified. 
`DATETIME` | `[next] ddd [hh[.mm]{am/pm}]` or `DD-MM-YYYY TT:TT`
`FREQUENCY` | `X{d/w/m/y}` where X is a natural number, d is day, m is month, and y is year.

The `PERIOD` represents the period of time which the event is occurring.

> Similarly like tasks, events can have any number of tags. Tags may contain spaces and are case-insensitive (i.e. tags "school", "School", and "SCHOOL" are the same tags).

Examples:
* `add CS2103T Lecture p/fri 2pm to fri 4pm r/1w t/CS2103T`

> * The list returns tasks only by default. Lists with `e/` returns events only while lists with `all/` returns both tasks and events.

> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `CS3244 Homework` will match `Homework CS3244`
> * Only the title is searched.
> * Only full words will be matched e.g. `CS` will not match `CS3244`
> * Tasks/Events matching at least one keyword or one tag will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `CS3244` will match `CS3244 Homework`, a task with tags `t/CS2103T` and `t/hw` will match a search for `t/hw`

Examples:
* `find CS2103T`<br>
  Returns Tasks with `CS2103T` in their titles
* `find CS2101 CS3230 CS2103T t/hw`<br>
