### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="600"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskman/logic/Logic.java)

When input from the user is entered, the UI would call on the Logic component to act on the command entered. 
We use CommandParser to help create the appropriate Command object, depending on the input by the user. 

For the more complicated concrete Command subclasses, we implement prepare{Command} in the Command subclass 
to parse the fields entered by the user according to the type of command specifically. 

The Command objects can change the 'HistoryDeque', Model, Storage components and/or raise events. 

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the execute("delete d1") API call.

Commands that have been successfully executed (checked with result.success) and 
have been flagged for storing (through the storeHistory field) will undergo an additional process as above. 

A `CommandHistory` object will be created, storing fields related to the state of the Model before the command was 
executed, as well as the input string for the command. This object will then be stored into the HistoryDeque. 

The HistoryDeque is utilized by the History and Undo commands, 
containing snapshots of the Model component at different states.

The above figure illustrates the storeHistory field for commands. 
The storeHistory field is set to true for some commands, and false for others.
View Command.java & the respective concrete Commands for more details.

In summary, the Logic Component:
Uses the CommandParser class to parse the user command.
Executes the resultant Command object.
Can affect the Model (e.g. adding a task), Storage (e.g. alter save location),  HistoryDeque and/or raise events.
Passes result of the command execution as a CommandResult object to the UI component.
1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

#### Editing a task/event: `edit`
Edits an activity in TaskMan<br>
##### For a Task:
Command Format: `edit INDEX TITLE [d/DEADLINE] [s/SCHEDULE] [c/STATUS] [t/TAG]...`
##### For an Event:
Command Format: `edit INDEX TITLE [s/SCHEDULE] [t/TAG]...`


Fields which are not present are assumed to stay unchanged. By adding tags, previous tags are removed and the new tags are added to the activity.

Examples:
* `list`<br>
  `edit s7 swallow magic pill s/friday 2pm for 30 minutes`<br>
* `edit d2 tell Alex to study for exam d/next fri 9am`
* `edit f1 master driving d/12 saturdays from now`
* `edit d1 d/8pm`

#### Completing a Task: `complete`
Marks the specified task as completed.
Command Format: `complete INDEX`

#### Deleting a task: `delete`
Deletes the specified task from TaskMan.<br>
Command Format: `delete INDEX`

> Deletes the task at the specified `INDEX`.
  The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
  The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:
* `list`<br>
  `delete f4`<br>
  Deletes the fourth activity in the Floating panel.
* `list CS2101`<br>
  `delete d9`<br>
  Deletes the ninth activity in the Deadline panel.
