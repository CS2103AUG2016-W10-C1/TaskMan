**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskman/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component is where you should be looking at if you are interested in how the application 
interacts with the user. The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, 
`ResultDisplay`, `ActivityPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. You can load all these UI parts, including the
`MainWindow`, using the `UiPartLoader` as they inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

5. Occasional conflict of data even when used only on one platform/device.
