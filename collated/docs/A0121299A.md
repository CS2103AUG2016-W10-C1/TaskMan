You can load multiple `ActivityPanel` parts in the `MainWindow` and control 
the kind of display for the `Activity` objects in the panel through 
the `ActivityCardLoader` class.

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskman/model/Model.java)

You should handle all the data which the user interacts with (i.e. tasks, events and tags) 
here in the `Model` component. We use `TaskMan` to store the core data for the application and 
`ModelManager` uses the core data from `TaskMan` to produce sorted and filtered lists 
(using `UnmodifiableObservableList<Activity>`) for the UI components. You should ensure
changes to the core data of `TaskMan` should be made through the `Model` interface.

`Activity` is a wrapper class for `Task` and `Event` objects. All three classes inherit the `ReadOnlyEvent` interface. 
You can view `Task` as an extension of `Event`, which has an additional 
optional `Deadline` and compulsory `Status` field.

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskman/storage/Storage.java)

You should use the `Storage` component to handle the file-writing and file-reading 
operations required for `TaskMan`. Currently the `StorageManager` has two other parts: 
`UserPrefStorage` for reading and writing user preferences and `TaskManStorage` 
for reading and writing TaskMan data.

#### Config

We designed the `Config` class using the Singleton pattern, to reduce any direct coupling 
required between `Config` and the other major components. It has its own file-reading and 
file-writing mechanism as it needs to be initialised before the other components. 
`Config` extends from `ConfigData`, which objects you can use to contain the data for `Config`.

#### Use case 4: Undo action

**MSS**

1. User requests to list actions applied in the session
2. TaskMan shows a list of actions applied in the session
3. User requests to undo all actions which were after a specified action by selecting that action
4. User confirms his request to undo
6. TaskMan undoes the action(s) <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. TaskMan shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

5a. User cancels his confirmation

> Use case resumes at step 2

#### Setting the save and load location: `storageloc`
Saves to the specified file name and location and sets the application to load from the specified location in the future.<br>
The command can be used to save the data to the default location or to view the current storage location.<br>
TaskMan data are saved in data/taskMan.txt in the application folder by default.<br>

Format: `storageloc [LOCATION]`

Examples:
* `storageloc C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/new_tasks.xml`<br>
    Sets the new save and load location to C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/new_tasks.xml
* `storageloc default`<br>
    Sets the new save and load location to tasks.xml in the current application folder
* `storageloc view`<br>
    Displays the current storage location

## File Format
The file is saved in xml format, which is easy to read and write with appropriate editors.

#### Task
Each Task is saved in the following format:
> `<tasks>`<br>
> `<title>TITLE</title>`<br>
> `<deadline>DD-MM-YYYY TT:TT</deadline>`<br>
> `<scheduleStart>DD-MM-YYYY TT:TT</scheduleStart>`<br>
> `<scheduleEnd>DD-MM-YYYY TT:TT</scheduleEnd>`<br>
> `<tagged>TAGNAME</tagged>`<br>
> `<tagged>TAGNAME</tagged>`<br>
> `</tasks>`<br>

Fields which are empty can be left out.<br>
Example:
> `<tasks>`<br>
> `<title>CS2103T Tutorial HW</title>`<br>
> `<deadline>11-10-2016 23:59</deadline>`<br>
> `<tagged>CS2103T</tagged>`<br>
> `</tasks>`

#### Event
Each Event is saved in the following format:
> `<event>`<br>
> `<title>TITLE</title>`<br>
> `<scheduleStart>DD-MM-YYYY TT:TT</scheduleStart>`<br>
> `<scheduleEnd>DD-MM-YYYY TT:TT</scheduleEnd>`<br>
> `<tagged>TAGNAME</tagged>`<br>
> `<tagged>TAGNAME</tagged>`<br>
> `</event>`

Fields which are empty can be left out.<br>
Example:
> `<event>`<br>
> `<title>CS2103T Lecture</title>`<br>
> `<scheduleStart>01-10-2016 12:00</scheduleStart>`<br>
> `<scheduleEnd01-10-2016 14:00</scheduleEnd>`<br>
> `<tagged>CS2103T</tagged>`<br>
> `</event>`

```
