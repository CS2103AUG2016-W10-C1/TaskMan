## About

TaskMan is a task management application which stores data locally. It aims to ease the way you record and search through your daily activities.

TaskMan is specifically designed for users who favour working entirely from the keyboard. Instead of navigating through the application with mouse clicks, you simply need to type the necessary commands and shortcuts.

This guide will get you started in just a few steps. It also has detailed 'how to' instructions on each feature of the application and a command summary which can be referred to anytime.


## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
1. Download the latest `taskman.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TaskMan.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
