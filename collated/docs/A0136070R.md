## Introduction

TaskMan is a task manager for keyboard lovers. It is a Java desktop application which accepts inputs in the form of commands typed by the user. The GUI is for output.

This guide is for developers to understand the workings behind TaskMan. It describes the design, requirements, analysis of existing task managers, and the implementation of TaskMan. It will guide you with setting up the development environment for TaskMan and prime you towards your first patch.

Please refer to the [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md) on how to use the application as an end-user. Having a go with the actual application also helps greatly when working on the business logic of the app. Do give it a try!

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `TaskMan` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case 1: Delete task

**MSS**

1. User requests to list tasks
2. TaskMan shows a list of tasks
3. User requests to delete a specific task in the list
4. User confirms his request to delete the specific task in the list
5. TaskMan deletes the task <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. TaskMan shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

4a. User cancels his confirmation

> Use case resumes at step 2

```

## Appendix C : Non Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any [mainstream OS](#mainstream-os) as long as it has Java `1.8.0_60` or higher installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 tasks.
3. Should come with automated unit tests and open source code.
4. Should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
5. Data file(s) should be in human-readable format.
6. Storage files are locked from external writing when the application is running.
7. UI should be eye-friendly.
8. Users should be visually informed when the application hangs.
9. Each operation should not take more than a second to respond.

### 2. [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)
#### Strengths
1. CLI GTD tool
2. No GUI but data is rendered clearly on CLI
3. Flexibility in commands (can adapt to changes in some of the command sequences, and lots of optional option flags available)
4. Data stored as human-readable text files
5. Data may be exported or imported in JSON format
6. Able to synchronise across devices via cloud storage

#### Limitations
7. Inconvenient to set up in Windows
8. All commands must be prepended with "task" because TaskWarrior does not create a CLI environment for itself
9. Commands always require Shift + Key (e.g. colons, plus signs and underscores) which slow down typing especially for keyboards without number pads

## About

TaskMan is a task management application which stores data locally. It aims to ease the way you record and search through your daily activities.

TaskMan is specifically designed for users who favour working entirely from the keyboard. Instead of navigating through the application with mouse clicks, you simply need to type the necessary commands and shortcuts.

This guide will get you started in just a few steps. It also has detailed 'how to' instructions on each feature of the application and a command summary which can be referred to anytime.


## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
1. Download the latest `taskman.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TaskMan.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
   > <img src="images/UI.png">

4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.
5. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`list`**: lists all tasks
   * **`add`**` eat vitamins s/fri 1400 for 5 minutes f/2 days t/ribena` :
     adds a task titled `eat vitamins` to TaskMan
   * **`delete`**` 3`: deletes the third task shown in the current list
   * **`exit`**: exits the app
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>


## Features

> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional.
> * Only one item should be picked from items in `CURLY_BRACES`.
> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.

Parameter | Format
-------- | :-------- 
`TITLE` | Any sequence of alphanumeric characters
`SCHEDULE` | `DATETIME`, `DATETIME to DATETIME` or `DATETIME for DURATION` 
`DEADLINE` and `DATETIME` | `[this/next] ddd [hhmm]`
`DURATION` | `<number> <unit of time>`
`TAG` | Can contain spaces and are case-insensitive


#### Viewing help: `help`
Command Format: `help`

> * Typing help or pressing F1 displays a list of commands available in TaskMan, along with their description and respective command formats.
> * Help is also shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. abcd.
> * You may navigate down the help window via the up and down arrow keys, and to exit the help window and return to TaskMan, simply press ESC.

#### Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task to TaskMan<br>
Command Format: `add TITLE [d/DEADLINE] [s/SCHEDULE] [t/TAG]...`

The `SCHEDULE` represents the period of time the task is scheduled to be worked on. Tasks can have any number of `TAG`s.

#### Listing all tasks: `list`
Shows a list of all activities whose titles contain any of the given keywords or contains any given tags.<br>
Command Format: `list [{s, d, f}] [KEYWORD]... [t/TAG]... `

> * List called with an empty argument displays all activities.
> * List with `KEYWORD` or `TAG`s filters all 3 panels in TaskMan
> * List can be called with the paramters `{s, d, f}` to filter specific panels
> * The search is case-insensitive. e.g `cs3244` will match `CS3244`
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `CS3244 Homework` will match `Homework CS3244`
> * Only full words will be matched e.g. `CS` will not match `CS3244`
> * Tasks/Events matching at least one keyword or one tag will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `CS3244` will match `CS3244 Homework`, a task with tags `t/programming` and `t/hw` will match a search for `t/hw`
